```{r}
library(nycflights13)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

flights
```

#1. Compute the average delay by destination, then join on the airports data frame so you can show the spatial distribution of delays. Hereâ€™s an easy way to draw a map of the United States:
```{r}
flights %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>% 
  summarize(mean_arr_delay = mean(arr_delay,na.rm=T))  %>%
  inner_join(airports, by = c(dest = "faa")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(lon, lat, colour = mean_arr_delay)) +
    borders("state") +
    geom_point() +
    coord_quickmap()
```

#2. Add the location of the origin and destination (i.e. the lat and lon) to flights:
```{r}
flights %>%
  select(year:hour, day, origin, dest) %>%
  left_join(
    airports %>%
  select(faa, lat, lon),
    by = c("origin" = "faa")
  ) %>%
  left_join(
    airports %>%
  select(faa, lat, lon),
    by = c("dest" = "faa")
  )
```

#3. Is there a relationship between the age of a plane and its delays?
```{r}
flights %>% 
  mutate(tot_delay = arr_delay + dep_delay) %>%
  group_by(tailnum) %>%
  summarize(mean_arr_delay = mean(arr_delay,na.rm=T)) %>% 
  left_join(select(planes, tailnum, year), by = "tailnum") %>%
  mutate(year = 2013 - year) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = year, x = mean_arr_delay)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line()+
  geom_smooth()
```
